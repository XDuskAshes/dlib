# DuskLib

A simple ComputerCraft:Tweaked library with a (to-be) menagerie of usefulness.
To download it in your local instance, you can do any of the two following:

1. From the main terminal:
   
   ``wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XDuskAshes/dlib/main/src/dlib.lua``

2. In a program (my method):[^1]
   
   ``shell.run("wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XDuskAshes/dlib/main/src/dlib.lua")``

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The above places ``dlib.lua`` in the **WORKING DIRECTORY**, viewable either via the directory behind the ``>`` in the terminal or by ``print(shell.dir())`` in a program.

[^1]: Someone please replace this with a better method, if any at all, as I know mine works but it ain't pretty.
